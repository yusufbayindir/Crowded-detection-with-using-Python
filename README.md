Crowded Detection and Birds Eye View Heatmap Project
About the Project
This project is designed to detect the number of people in crowded areas and visualize this data in a bird's-eye view heatmap. It is particularly useful for monitoring public spaces, events, and high-traffic areas to understand and manage crowd density effectively.

Features
Crowded Detection: Utilizes advanced algorithms to accurately count individuals in densely populated areas.
Birds Eye View Heatmap: Transforms detection data into a heatmap, providing a bird's-eye perspective of crowd distribution.
Real-Time Analysis: Offers real-time processing and visualization capabilities.
